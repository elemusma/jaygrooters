								<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a magical night, the fire had burned low,<br>
									And the guests had all gone to bed.<br>
									There were five of us left -- our family of four<br>
									And the battered old cowboy who looked half dead.<br>
									<br>
									His body was bent and mis-shapen by work,<br>
									By years of shoeing horses, and by falls.<br>
									We sat by the campfire, one warm summer night,<br>
									Listening to the wind and the wild coyote calls.<br>
									<br>
									Then Edgar, the old cowboy, started singing his songs,<br>
									In his monotone, gravelly voice so strange,<br>
									Not the modern well known ones, but the really old ones<br>
									That they sang years ago on the range.<br>
									<br>
									The wind whistled gently, the aspens leaves rustled,<br>
									And the coyotes howled out their refrain.<br>
									At once we were transported sixty years back,<br>
									To when Edgar was a young cowboy again.<br>
									<br>
									After a while he grew quiet, and we savored the sounds<br>
									That we'd heard ... a time beautiful and rare.<br>
									Then he told us a poem about lion hunting and dogs,<br>
									A personal thing he'd very rarely share.<br>
									. . .<br>
									<br>
									He rumbled: &quot;Come all you rough and tough hombres<br>
									Draw up your chairs to the fire<br>
									And we'll make big talk of lion hunting<br>
									To see who rates as the biggest liar.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									&quot;Some folks will tell you that hunting 'em is easy<br>
									To run them and tree'em is a snap<br>
									But pay them not much heed, little brother<br>
									For that is all a big bunch of . . baloney.&quot;<br>
									<br>
									&quot;You gotta be tough like the rawhide<br>
									And you gotta be rough like a cob.<br>
									And if you don't have these qualifications<br>
									You had darn well better not start on the Job.&quot;<br>
								</font>
								<p>
									<font face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;I've run them in snow to my pockets<br>
										In weather way down below zero.<br>
										And the first fifty years are the roughest<br>
										After that you might could be a hero.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;We have run them till darkness o'ertook us<br>
										Then make camp on the track for the night<br>
										You build a good fire to keep warm by<br>
										All you have got to do is wait for day light.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;With nothing to eat, not even a bisquit<br>
										Before morning your hunger is acute<br>
										And you ask the Good Lord to grant one favor<br>
										And that's let me latch on to that brute.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;And along about daylight next morning<br>
										After you have shivered the most of the night<br>
										You'll make of your mind for darn certain<br>
										That a lion hunter is not too darned bright.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;I'll give you the specifications to hunt lions<br>
										And to kinda set up front with the experts<br>
										It takes lots of guts and determination<br>
										And a size one hat and size 44 shirts.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;And whether you hunt them for money or pleasure<br>
										You will find lots of sorrows and joys<br>
										And if you live up to the specifications<br>
										It will darn well sort out the men from the boys.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;You will never hear more blessed music<br>
										Than Old Ranger and Spot and Old Red<br>
										As they run a hot track down the canyon<br>
										With the old cat not too far ahead.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;Now listen to them old hounds a'straining<br>
										As each one is trying to stay in the lead<br>
										But now they have stopped their running<br>
										And I'll bet you the chips they have treed.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;Let us get to them, you muscle-brained heros<br>
										Get prepared for a beautiful sight<br>
										For the old lion will look down from the tree top<br>
										And the old hounds will all want to fight.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;Well the lion has been treed and slaughtered<br>
										This brings to an end the wild chase<br>
										As night settles in, your work is not ended<br>
										For you're ten miles from home in a heck of a place.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;The weather is cold as a well diggers gable end<br>
										Things don't look too cheerful and bright<br>
										The snow is knee deep and is crusted<br>
										I wonder if we will ever get home tonight.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;We stagger in to the home spread about midnight<br>
										Both the men and dogs are tired and foot sore<br>
										And we tell the whole world to heck with it all<br>
										We'll never hunt lions no more.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;Well I've hunted with some darned fine fellows<br>
										The most of them True Blue to be sure<br>
										But once in a while one can't help but be chicken<br>
										And he smells of the fresh chicken manure.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;They tell of a beautiful place called Heaven<br>
										Where nothing is known of sorrow or care<br>
										But if they don't have snow to track lions<br>
										What in heck would I do if I was up there?&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;One night as I sat by the camp fire<br>
										I looked at the stars in the sky<br>
										And I couldn't help but wonder if ever a lion hunter<br>
										Had made it all the way to that sweet bye and bye.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										&quot;I am sure not one ever made it<br>
										I don't think very many would want to go<br>
										But if there was any way of telling<br>
										I am sure you would find several down below'&quot;<br>
