																							Grooters was approached last

																							the church and Rose Mary
																							Gergen of Burlington, Colo.,
																							to begin work on the window.
																							&quot;She wanted this
																							particular representation of
																							Mary and Father Gregory and
																							I met several times to see
																							how we wanted things to turn
																							out. We wanted some flowers
																							and meadows and mountains,
																							of course. We went through
																							about 5 different designs
																							before we got to exactly
																							what we wanted. I have a
																							program that is for
																							designing stained glass
																							windows on the computer.
																							Frankly, I don't know how I
																							would do this the old way,
																							making a design and
																							transferring it down on the
																							pattern. It took 52 sheets
																							of paper when I printed out
																							the full size design. It
																							gives me a way to show
																							people approximately how it
																							is going to look. The colors
																							aren't exactly true colors,
																							because you won't be able to
																							tell that until you get the
																							glass in there, but it's an
																							approximation. We started
																							talking about the window
																							maybe in July,&quot; he
																							said.&nbsp;&quot;But my wife
																							Fran and I run the Alpine
																							Trail Ridge Inn, so summers
																							aren't really free for me to
																							be devoting that kind of

																			in and installing the frame, and then
																			getting some scaffolding and intalling it.
																			But it wasn't very heavy, and I could move

																			do with the building. Father's idea is that
																			the whole inside of the church should have
																			some kind of aspect of Mary's life
																			represented in the windows. Father Gregory
																			has a very good sense of design. He's very
																			artistic in his own way. I didn't know some

																			Catholic Church uses, and he kept me in line
																			with that. He's also a very good marketer -
																			he's got the fellow that has the Chocolate
																			Drop who donates these chocolate bars.

																							they're going through or
																							help them through a
